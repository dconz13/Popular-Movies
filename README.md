This is stage 2 of the Popular Movies app for the Udacity Nanodegree. It allows the user to load movies sorted by
either popularity or highest rated. It pulls the JSON information from themoviedb.org. It has the main grid that shows movie posters and then a Settings activity and Detail activity. 

This is a work in progress. I still need to make it look nice when I learn how and add some UI features.
